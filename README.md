---------------------------

### Infrastructure:

This project was created with ```next.js```.

All styling was made with the beloved CSS-In-JS ```styled-components```.

Also powered by ```typescript```.

For productivity and clean code enhancement, those libs were used:

- ```gql``` and ```GraphQLClient``` for querying the API.
- ```eslint``` and ```prettier``` for clean code.
- ```react-responsive``` for querying mobile/desktop sizes directly on JSX.

### Features:

- Fully typescript;
- Deployed to Vercel;
- Customizable SEO;
- Google Analytics implemented and registering traffic!

### IMPORTANT:

Below are instructions to run this application.<br />
Please keep in mind that to fetch data from API, a GraphCMS token is required. If you need access, contact admin.

- Open terminal/cmd on unzipped folder;
- Run: *yarn install* or *npm install*
- Create a preview running: *yarn dev* or *npm run dev*

### SPECIAL THANKS TO GRAPHCMS!
